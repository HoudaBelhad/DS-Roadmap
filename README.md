# 📚 The Software Engineer's Java Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Roadmap

## Welcome to the DSA Fundamentals Repository! 🚀

This repository is my personal, comprehensive roadmap for reviewing and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, implemented entirely in **Java**. As a Software Engineer, I created this project to establish a clean, reliable, and well-documented reference for the core concepts of computer science.

Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking a solid reference point, you will find value here.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized by core DSA concepts. Each major concept has its own dedicated folder.

```

DS\_Rodmap/
├── Arrays/                    \# Folder for Array concepts (1D, 2D, etc.)
│   ├── arrays.java            \# Well-documented Java implementation
│   └── demo/
│       └── demo.md            \# Simple explanation and execution guide
├── Lists/                     \# Folder for List concepts (ArrayList, LinkedList)
├── Stacks\_Queues/             \# Folder for Stack and Queue concepts
├── Trees\_Graphs/              \# Folder for Trees (BST, AVL) and Graph concepts
└── README.md                  \# This file

## ✨ What You Will Find Inside

### 1. **Well-Documented Code**
Every Java file (`.java`) features **extensive, English-language comments**. The code is designed to be clear, readable, and follow best practices. **Feel free to copy, execute, and adapt the code** for your own learning or projects.

### 2. **Simple Explanations**
Inside each concept folder, you will find an explanatory **Markdown file (`.md`)**. These files (like `demo.md`) provide a **simple, high-level breakdown** of the structure, including:
* A concise definition of the data structure.
* A brief overview of the Java implementation.
* Screenshots of the execution results to help you quickly verify the code.

### 3. **Reference-Ready**
* **For Beginners:** You can use this repository as a **guided course**. Take the code, execute it step-by-step, and read the simple explanations to build your foundational knowledge.
* **For Intermediates/Seniors:** The clean, commented implementations make this an **ideal reference library**. Need a quick refresher on how to implement a basic Array traversal or a specific sorting algorithm? You will find exactly what you need quickly.
